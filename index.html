        <h3>I started taking classes at Bitwise because I was tired of working retail jobs and feeling like I was stuck. A friend of mine told me about the Geekwise classes and I thought I'd give it a shot. Three months later, I was offered an internship at Edit LLC and shortly after, I was accepted into the cohort and never looked back.</h3>
